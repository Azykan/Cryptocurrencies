#### Tools:
- Data Preprocessing (Selection, Transformation, Scaling) - the process of helping to prepare data for Machine Learning Algorithms.
- Elbow Curve - method to determine the best number of clusters needed for the algorithm to group the objects by.
- Principal Component Analysis (PCA) - statistical technique to speed up machine learning algorithms when the number of features is too high.
- Clustering Algorithms (KMeans) - the process of grouping similar objects/data points into clusters.
- Visualization (hvPlot, Plotly) - graphic libraries that allows us to create 2D and 3D graphs such as, scatter plots.
